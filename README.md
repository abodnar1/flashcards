## Project Overview
This program was written to simulate a set of flashcards that can be reviewed through the command line. It welcomes the player to the game with a note that shows how many cards are in their deck. The player is able to see a question with a list of possible answers, click `enter` to choose their guess, and see if their guess is correct. At the end of the round, after reviewing all 30 cards, the player will see how many cards they answered correctly.

The [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) provided a project spec sheet for students to follow, which can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/flash-cards.html). The objective was for students to contribute code to a partially constructed object-oriented application, implement ES6 classes, and implement a robust testing suite using TDD.

## Technologies and Tools
* JavaScript
* MacOS Terminal
* Atom
* Git
* Github

## Setup
1. Fork this Repo
2. Clone it down to your machine
3. `cd` into the root of the project directory
4. Run `node index.js` in your terminal to start playing. You will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards.

## Roadmap
Future features could include:
* updating the `Game` class so that the player can review a different deck of cards each round
* adding functionality so that the player could review the questions they answered incorrectly
* adding functionality so that if the player's final score was less than a targeted percentage, the player would have to go through the deck again.
